# Desubvocalizer

read words faster without moving your eyes

## Product Pitch
You know how you read a piece of content on the web and you have to move your eyes and make an effort to track the way the content goes down the page. 

Well it would be a lot easier for you to read every word if it flashed across your screen quickly.

If you take a markdown file you can divide headings and content for varied time per word.

## Notes

Parse markdown file
Display words in terminal
GUI

## Extension of idea

could be a browser extension

# Using AI to determine how long a word should appear on the screen for.
